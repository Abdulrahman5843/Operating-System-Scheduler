# Operating-System-Scheduler
This project implements five CPU scheduling algorithms to demonstrate how they work and affect task management. The project is divided into files to keep things simple and easy to read. Each file contains a different scheduling algorithm.

## Key Features
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** Tasks are executed in the order they arrive.
- **Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive) (SJFNP):** Runs the job with the shortest execution time.
- **Shortest Job First (Preemptive) (SJFP):** Selects the task with the shortest remaining time.
- **Priority Scheduling:** Processes tasks based on assigned priority levels.
- **Round Robin (RR):** Assigns a fixed time slice to tasks in a circular order.



## How to Run
### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman5843/Project

basg
cd Project

## Key Features
Separate Files: Each algorithm is in its own file for better code management.
Average Time Calculations: Each algorithm calculates average waiting and turnaround times.
Interactive Input: Some algorithms ask for user input for burst time, arrival time, and priority.
## Challenges Faced
Connecting lecture content with programming implementation.
Synchronizing data between arrays.
Difficulty combining individual member codes.
Late project start due to learning curve.
## Conclusion
This project provided insight into different CPU scheduling methods and their impact on performance. Each algorithm has strengths and weaknesses, making it important to select the right one for specific tasks.
